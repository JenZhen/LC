Uninon Find 并查集
- 用来解决“查询合并”的数据结构
- find O(1); union O(1)

- find: check if nodes are in the same set, ie. find the root

// Find template, WITHOUT compression
int find(int x) {
  if (Father(x) == x) {
    return x
  }
  return find(Father(x))
}

Example
A <- B <- C
Given C, return its final root A

// Find template, WITH compression
int find(int x) {
  if (Father(x) == x) {
    return x
  }
  // Eventually find x's root and update x' father node
  Father(x) = find(Father(x))
  return Father(x)
}

Example
A <- B <- C (A's father points at itself)
Given C, return its final root A, and update father node along the way.
C -> A <- B (A's father points at itself)

Amortized cost for find operation is O(1)

- union: make sets of nodes together, ie. union the root
It refers to union of 2 roots not related to it's leaves

// Union template
void union(int a, int b) {
  int root_a = find(a) // O(1)
  int root_b = find(b) // O(1)
  if (root_a != root_b) {
    // merge root_a to root_b
    father[root_a] = root_b
  }
}

Time complexity: O(1)

** Summary **
- Familiar with union-find template (5min)
- Find the root
- Union the roots (rule defined by myself)

Application Extension
- Find out count of elements in a set
- Find out count of sets (ie. count of roots)
  Number_of_Islands
  Number_of_Islands_II
- Return all sets
  Connected_Component_in_Undirected_Grap
  Find_the_Weak_Connected_Component_in_the_Directed_Graph
- Handle duplication, (i, j) marked as 1 then again
  Number_of_Islands_II
- Union operation make sure all points to a certain father
