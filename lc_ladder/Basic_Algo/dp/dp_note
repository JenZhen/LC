1. Essense of Dynamic Programming
- Divide big problem into small problems
- Solve small problems first, save the value, derive bigger problem from memorized small problems

2. Ideas:
- Memoried Search
- Iteration

3. Frequently Asked Questions:
- Matrix DP (10%): Unique Path
- Sequence DP (40%): Clime Stairs
- Two Sequences DP (40%)
- Backpack (10%)

4. Steps
- State: How to represent problems and save the value
- Function: How to derive big problem from small problems
- Initialization: How to init corner cases, ie the ones that cannot be derived from
- Answer: Which part the problem is the answer

5. Hint of DP
- One of the keywords in the problem
1) Max/Min 2) Yes/No 3) Count

- Input type of data cannot be sorted/swapped
