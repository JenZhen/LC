# https://www.lintcode.com/problem/max-tree/description
# Given an integer array with no duplicates. A max tree building on this array is defined as follow:
# The root is the maximum number in the array
# The left subtree and right subtree are the max trees of the subarray divided by the root number.
# Construct the max tree by the given array.
# Example
# Given [2, 5, 6, 0, 3, 1], the max tree constructed by this array is:
#     6
#    / \
#   5   3
#  /   / \
# 2   0   1
# O(n) time and memory.
