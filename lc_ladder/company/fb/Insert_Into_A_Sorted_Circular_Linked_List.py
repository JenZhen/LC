# https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-sorted-circular-linked-list/
# Example
# Given a node from a Circular Linked List which is sorted in ascending order,
# write a function to insert a value insertVal into the list such that it remains a sorted circular list.
# The given node can be a reference to any single node in the list, and may not be necessarily the smallest value in the circular list.
#
# If there are multiple suitable places for insertion, you may choose any place to insert the new value.
# After the insertion, the circular list should remain sorted.
#
# If the list is empty (i.e., given node is null), you should create a new single circular list and
# return the reference to that single node. Otherwise, you should return the original given node.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: head = [3,4,1], insertVal = 2
# Output: [3,4,1,2]
# Explanation: In the figure above, there is a sorted circular list of three elements.
# You are given a reference to the node with value 3, and we need to insert 2 into the list.
# The new node should be inserted between node 1 and node 3. After the insertion, the list should look like this, and we should still return node 3.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: head = [], insertVal = 1
# Output: [1]
# Explanation: The list is empty (given head is null). We create a new single circular list and return the reference to that single node.
#
# Example 3:
# Input: head = [1], insertVal = 0
# Output: [1,0]
#
# Constraints:
#
# 0 <= Number of Nodes <= 5 * 10^4
# -10^6 <= Node.val <= 10^6
# -10^6 <= insertVal <= 10^6
